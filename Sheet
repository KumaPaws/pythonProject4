Good Day for our asynchronous class please answer the following problems:

1. Create a program that will accept a decimal (base 10)
number. Convert the number
to binary (base 2) using manual conversion (do not use built in function).

2. Create a program that will accept a
hexadecimal (base 16) number.
Convert the number to Decimal (base 10) using
manual conversion (do not use built in function).
Note: Study the conversion process, implement it in coding.

You are required to use function
The use of module is optional.
This is equivalent to 100 points activity. 50 points each.
